# Simple_memory_game-project
A simple memory game in Java is a card-matching game where the player aims to match pairs of cards by flipping them over. Initially, all cards are face-down, and the player selects two cards at a time. If the cards match, they remain face-up; if not, they flip back over. The game continues until all pairs are matched. The game can be implemented using a graphical user interface (GUI) with Java Swing, where cards are represented as buttons or images. The game logic includes randomizing the card placement, tracking the player's moves, and optionally adding features like a timer and a move counter. The game is won when all pairs are successfully matched.
